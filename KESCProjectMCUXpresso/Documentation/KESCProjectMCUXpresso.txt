Module "GPIOA"     (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - GPIOA_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "GPIOB"     (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - GPIOB_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "FTM2"      (component Init_FTM_VAR0)
   - FTM2_Init -This method initializes registers of the FTM module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "IFsh1"     (component IntFLASH)
   - IFsh1_DisableEvent -This method disables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_EnableEvent -This method enables all the events except <OnSaveBuffer>, <OnRestoreBuffer> and <OnEraseError>. The 
                method is available only if any event is enabled.
   - IFsh1_SetByteFlash -Writes a byte to an address in FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" 
                property and state of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.
   - IFsh1_SetWordFlash -Writes a word to an address in FLASH. The operation of this method depends on the "Write method" 
                property and state of the flash. Please see more details on general info page of the help.

Module "CRC1"      (component CRC_LDD)
   - CRC1_Init -Initializes the device and allocates memory for the private device data structure.
   - CRC1_GetCRCResult -Returns actual CRC result. This method cannot be disabled if at least one of the following methods is 
                enabled: GetCRC8, GetCRC16, GetCRC32, GetBlockCRC.
   - CRC1_GetCRC8 -This method appends 1 data byte to current CRC calculation and returns new result. It automatically enables 
                code generation of GetCRCResult method.
   - CRC1_ResetCRC -Reset CRC module for new CRC computation. This method keeps previous settings (CRC standard, seed value...).

Module "Cpu"       (component MKE02Z64QH2)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables all maskable interrupts.
   - Cpu_SystemReset -This method initiates a system reset request to reset the CPU.
